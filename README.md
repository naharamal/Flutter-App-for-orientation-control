# A Flutter App that can communicate with a PC using different orientation and movements

This app is a personal project of mine. In this I read the phone sensory data to detect different orientation and movements. These movements are translated to certain commands and is send to a PC using http server client method. Then a [python backend](https://github.com/naharamal/Python-backend-for-a-flutter-app) will read these commands and do specified tasks. I used this to control music player, GTA game character movement.
