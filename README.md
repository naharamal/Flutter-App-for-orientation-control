# A Flutter App that communicate can communicate with a PC using different orientation

This app is a personal project of mine. In this I read the phone sensory data to detect different orientation and movements. These movements are translated to certain commands and is send to a PC using http server client method. Then a python backend will read these commands and do specified tasks.
